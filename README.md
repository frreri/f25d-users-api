# F25D - User API


This is a small web application I made as a turn in for my Frontend Development class.
It fetches mocked user data from a web API and displays it as cards in a grid.
The grid can be searched/filtered in realtime by typing in the search input field.


For this web app I went with a class approach where the app itself is a class that i import into the main file, then instatiate and initialize.
In the class I make use of private fields and methods with #, the instantiating and initializing of the app is done within a block scope {} which gives it even more encapsulation (not reachable directly from browser console)
